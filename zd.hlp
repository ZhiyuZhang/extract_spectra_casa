1 ZD 
       ZD Arg1 Arg2
       The aim of this script is to identify redshift with the strongest
       molecular lines in a spectrum. It can also handle the strong lines in
       the image frequency in red color.  But NOTE that you need to keep the
       original header information of the image frequency.

       USAGE:
  
       zd redshift velo_reso 
       
       example:
 
       zd 0.0012 120 

       This is a detailed description of ZD.
